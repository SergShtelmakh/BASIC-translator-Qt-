# Translator-Qt-
This is a simple translator for source code of some program language(for example BASIC). Now it contains two main modules: lexical analyzer and syntactic analyzer(under development). File "LexicalAnalyzersSettings.json" contains data for lexical analysis. File "SyntacticAnalyzersSetting.rules" contains syntactic rules in Backusâ€“Naur Form. 

Programs features:
- marking up keywords in source code by some colors.
- giving information about result of lexical analysis. (errors, tokens sequence, table of identifiers).
